# LatentVillage Code
This is the code that I've used to create the building blocks for Latent Village, an AI-generated game concept.

All the code can be found in the main.ipynb, and the pixel art portraits that I used to train the model are in /training-data.
A few of the outputs are also included here, including:
- LatentSpaceMap.png : the current latent space map that the model outputs, plotting the original training portraits based on their structure in the latent space.
- traverse_pc4.png : the latent space vector transformation that I showed in the promo video, which I believe has captured the long-hair to short-hair feature transition.
- recon_e200.png : the final state of the model training, showing a set of the last images it trained on, and the corresponding face that the model constructed by the end.

Most of the code was generated using ChatGPT 4, once I had explained the structure that I needed for the VAE, and the outputs that I wanted to see.
